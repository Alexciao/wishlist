# How to Setup Wishlist

1. Do the [Notion setup](https://github.com/Alexciao/wishlist/blob/master/doc/NOTION.md)
2. If you have a server, do the [Self-hosted setup](https://github.com/Alexciao/wishlist/blob/master/doc/SELF_HOSTING.md). Note that you'll need to update the app manually when new features or bug-fixes are released.
3. If you don't have a server, or you'd like easier updates, do the [Cloud hosting setup](https://github.com/Alexciao/wishlist/blob/master/doc/SELF_HOSTING.md). Don't worry, it's completely free.
